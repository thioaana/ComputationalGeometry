**Week 1 - Point Inclusion in a Polygon**

1.1 Points and Vector : 

Given a vector AB (starting at point A and ending at point B) and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine the relative position of each point 
with respect to the vector: point lies eitheron the right side, or on the left side, or on the vector, or on the continuation of the vector.

1.2 Points and Triangle

Given a triangle ABC and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine for each point whether it is inside, outside, or on the border of the triangle.

1.3 Points and Polygon

Given a simple polygon V 1 V 2 · · · V m and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine for eachpoint whether it is inside, outside, 
or on the border of the polygon.

1.4 Points and Convex Polygon

Given a simple convex polygon V 1 V 2 · · · V m and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine which of them are located inside, 
outside or on the border of the polygon.


**Week 2 - Convex Hulls**

2.1 Convex polygon

Given a simple polygon V 1 V 2 . . . V n , determine whether it is convex.

2.2 Build convex hull

Build a convex hull of the given n points (i.e., build a convex polygon with a minimum perimeter that contains all the points).

2.3 Tangents to polygon

Given a simple convex polygon V 1 V 2 . . . V m and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, for each point, build two tangents to the polygon. If the tangent lies on the continuation of the side of the polygon, output any vertex from this side.

2.4 Union of convex polygons

Compute the union of the given convex polygons.
