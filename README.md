**Week 1 - Point Inclusion in a Polygon**

1.1 Points and Vector : 

Given a vector AB (starting at point A and ending at point B) and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine the relative position of each point 
with respect to the vector: point lies eitheron the right side, or on the left side, or on the vector, or on the continuation of the vector.

1.2 Points and Triangle

Given a triangle ABC and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine for each point whether it is inside, outside, or on the border of the triangle.

1.3 Points and Polygon

Given a simple polygon V 1 V 2 · · · V m and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine for eachpoint whether it is inside, outside, 
or on the border of the polygon.

1.4 Points and Convex Polygon

Given a simple convex polygon V 1 V 2 · · · V m and n points p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n on the plane, determine which of them are located inside, 
outside or on the border of the polygon.


**Week 2 - Convex Hulls**
